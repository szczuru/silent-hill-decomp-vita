 * PGXP (perspective-correct rendering) — shadow-memory model, DuckStation-faithful.
 *
 * One shadow table parallels PSX memory: each entry is keyed by the NATIVE
 * ADDRESS of a vertex word (the packed s16 x | s16 y<<16 the GPU reads) and
 * holds the precise float screen X/Y + view W the GTE produced for that word,
 * the integer `value` it shadows (validation, never the key) and the frame
 * generation. Coverage is built by propagation along the data path, never by
 * heuristics:
 *   - GTE store (gte_stsxy*)               -> Shadow_Store(destAddr, fx,fy,w, value)
 *   - drawer copy (poly->xN = screenXy[f]) -> Shadow_Copy(&poly->xN, &screenXy[f])
 *   - GPU draw   (MakeVertex)              -> GetPreciseVertex(primFieldAddr, value, ...)
 * A vertex is either propagated (precise) or absent (clean affine, ppw=0). No
 * ring, no parked set, no nearest-match, no weld — those collide and oscillate.
 * Seams vanish for free: both bone-joint verts are tracked end-to-end and project
 * to the same precise value, so they coincide. All work is gated by g_PsxUsePgxp;
 * the off path is byte-identical to the legacy affine path.

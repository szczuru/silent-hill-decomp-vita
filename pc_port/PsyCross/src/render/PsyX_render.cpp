 * (the Harry-running loading-screen trail, every frame from GameBoot_LoadingScreen)
 * and the per-map ghosting/dream overlays all sample getTPage(2, 0, ...) display
 * pages. Those pages must therefore hold the previous frame.
 *
 * The catch that broke the first attempt at this: VRAM is a GL_RG8 texture whose
 * two channels hold the packed BYTES of a 16-bit PSX pixel — the sampling shader
 * reconstructs it as
 *     color_16 = (rg.y * 256.0 + rg.x) * 255.0
 *     rgb      = fract(floor(color_16 / vec4(1.0, 32.0, 1024.0, ...)) / 32.0)
 * i.e. bit 0-4 = R, 5-9 = G, 10-14 = B, 15 = mask; R channel = low byte, G = high.
 * A raw glBlitFramebuffer from the RGBA8 frame therefore CANNOT work: GL drops B/A
 * and keeps the R,G *colour* bytes, which the shader then decodes as a bit-packed
 * 555 word — saturated garbage stripes. (The CPU helper GR_CopyRGBAFramebufferToVRAM
 * packs R and B the wrong way round against this shader, so it is no use either.)
 *
 * So the store is a shader pass that packs RGBA8 -> RGB555 into RG, rendered
 * straight into the VRAM texture. Mask bit is left 0, so a pure-black source pixel
 * packs to word 0 and the sampler's `if (color_16 == 0.0) discard;` treats it as
 * transparent — exactly PSX texel-0 behaviour, which is what makes the loading
